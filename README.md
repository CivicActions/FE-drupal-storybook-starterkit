# CivicActions Storybook-based Drupal Theme Starterkit

This is a starterkit for setting up a component-based, Drupal 9+ theme with Storybook serving as the pattern library/design system documentation, and testing framework. This starterkit also makes use of the USWDS as its foundation.

# Setup
- Ensure you're using the correct node/npm version. Run: `nvm use`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run an initial build to set up required font/image assets from USWDS: `npm run build`
- Launch Storybook and start developing: `npm run develop`
